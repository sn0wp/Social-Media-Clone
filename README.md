# Social-Media-Clone
## Description

Take screenshots of pages on a popular social media site (Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest), and reverse engineer the HTML and CSS from scratch.

You can copy images and inspect the page using developer tools, but avoid copy-pasting! You'll learn a lot more this way.

Get as close as you can to the screenshot.

You don't need to add behavior.
## Context

Looking at the design of an interactive social media site is a great way to learn just how powerful the code that drives them can be. It is in reading and re-writing the code where we can continue to enhance our learning. 

Feel free to use frameworks and other libraries, but do not copy-paste, it is crucial that in typing the code out allows you to continually read and discover how the code works. 

As you code your site, you will likely encounter scenarios that you may not have expected, which is fine, it only means that you have more opportunities to problem-solve!
